# Perspectives on Data Science from a Developer

I attempt to provide a definition of data science through the prism of my own experience, building a data pipeline that performs sentiment analysis on Twitter posts. I defend the idea that it is a team sport and that most often, silos exist between the data science and engineering teams which cause unnecessary frictions, inefficiencies and ultimately a failure to realize its full potential. I also argue the point of view that data science is here to stay and that eventually, it will become an integral part of what is known today as computer science (I like to think that someday new terms will emerge like computer data science that better capture this duality).
